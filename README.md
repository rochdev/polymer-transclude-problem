# Polymer transclude problem

When used inside transclusion content, Polymer elements have unexpected
behaviour. This project is just an example of such problem. Ironically, it seems
to affect only Chrome (or at least it's the one most affected by the problem)

## Installation

```sh
$ bower install
```

Then you can start a simple server such as `http-server` or `live-server`

```sh
$ npm install -g live-server
$ live-server
```
